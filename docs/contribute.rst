Contribution
============

Magneto was built by Automation Engineers for Automation Engineers.

We're calling out for anyone using Magneto to open issues, discuss, fork and contribute code.
Note that we are sticklers for Magneto code, always contemplating the best approach
(coding and naming conventions, advanced programming patterns, generic implementations rather than specific etc.).
