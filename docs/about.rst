About Magneto
=============

Magneto was built by Automation Engineers for Automation Engineers out of necessity for a mobile centric test automation
framework that's easy to setup, run and utilize. At EverythingMe_, we went through many open source solutions but none
felt fast, easy and hassle free.

Magneto is written in **Python** for **Android** devices. It utilizes the uiautomator_ tool via
a `Python wrapper`_ and pytest_ as a test framework.

Magneto can be triggered from CLI, IDE and CI.

We invite you to use Magneto to test your Android products, to `open issues`_, to request features, to ask questions
and submit your own Pull Requests.
